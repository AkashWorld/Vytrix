# Vytrix - Matrix Library
A small matrix library that I made for educational purposes. Explores different ways to efficiently compute on matrices and exploit compiler optimizations and framework interfaces.

## Install
**Work in progress**  
Due to templating, Vytrix is header only.

## Tests
To run tests, invoke cmake and run the executable.
```
cmake PROJECT_ROOT
make
```
